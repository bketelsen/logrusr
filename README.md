# Minimal Go logging using logrus

This package implements the [logr interface](https://github.com/thockin/logr)
in terms of [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus).  This 
provides a relatively minimalist API to logging in Go, backed by a well-proven
implementation.

This is a BETA grade implementation.
